'''
    Problem:
        Find the 5th largest element in an unsorted array. 
        Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] 
        Output: No 5th Largest Number
    
    Example 2:
        Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] 
        Output: 4
    Note:
        You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.
